# Pacman

Next steps:
1. Fix the pacman time event - arrow keys only change directions
2. Fix the pacman position issue - currently it's not changing left margin with only the first left/right arrow key pressed.
3. Get the ghost(s) ramdomly moving
4. Add a background music
5. Have pacman go through the wall holes and appear on the other side of the world.
